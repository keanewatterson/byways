Cliff Drive has the distinction of being the only Missouri scenic byway located in an urban area. The corridor passes right through Kansas City, in scenic and historic George E. Kessler Park. The drive is significant for its historic and natural qualities.

__Historical Urban Design__

Cliff Drive represents a fine example of historic urban design. The design and planning effort of the byway is known worldwide. Additionally, Cliff Drive and the surrounding park were uniquely integral to the evolution and development of Kansas City as a major metropolitan area.

__Natural Wonders in the Big City__

Cliff Drive preserves natural features unique to this portion of the Missouri River Valley. Some of these features include limestone bluffs, natural vegetation, and wildlife. These features are particularly unusual because they are located immediately adjacent to the city core, within a heavily urbanized environment.
