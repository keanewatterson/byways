Plan to an spend entire day exploring this unique agricultural region. The Apple Way is pleasantly low-key and historically interesting.

For example, you can visit old Dutton Farm, the town's first maple syrup producer, which still taps its maples every spring. You can even see the farm's old sugar shack if you peek behind the barn.

The route is sprinkled with old schoolhouses, antique homesteads, and magnificent orchards. These orchards not only gave the byway its name, but are also famous for their excellent produce and flowers.

At well-known Sunnycrest Farm, you can pick your own apples, strawberries, blueberries, and flowers. Mack's Orchards is renowned for its apples, cider, and pumpkins.
