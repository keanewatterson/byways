Visit the Sterling Highway and the surrounding Kenai Peninsula for world-class recreational opportunities, including access to the Chugach National Forest, the Kenai National Wildlife Refuge, and numerous Alaska State Parks. With access to fishing, hiking, camping, hunting, mountain biking, river rafting, sea and river kayaking, back-country and cross-country skiing, wildlife viewing, canoeing, snowmobiling, bird watching, and dog-mushing, this byway has earned its reputation as  "Alaska's Playground" and and "Premier Fishing Byway in North America."

Exceptional fishing opportunities are accessible along the entire length of the Sterling Highway. The south segment provides access to world-class saltwater fishing, and the community of Homer is called the "Halibut Capital of the World". This world-class fishing is the most popular activity for both residents and visitors to Alaska.

In addition to world-class saltwater fishing, hundreds of recreation opportunities exist along the byway. A vast majority of those who visit the Sterling Highway also take advantage of other outstanding recreation opportunities found in the area.
