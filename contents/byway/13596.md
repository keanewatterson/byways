This level farming region unfolds an array of cross-tipped churches, all of which are on the National Register of Historic Places. Three are highlighted below:

* __St. Augustine Church__, built in 1848, is one of the area's oldest churches. As a highly esteemed place of worship, it has undergone many renovations. One such renovation was the addition of its impressive twin spires in 1874.

* In 1862, New England settlers built the __First Presbyterian Church__ in Wapakoneta. This church was built using a Greek Revival style, unlike other churches on the byway.

* Another unique church is __St. Joseph's Catholic Church__, which happens to sit just south of First Presbyterian. This building employs the rounded arches of the Romanesque Revival style.

The route features other sorts of history, as seen in part by Fort Recovery, the National Marian Shrine of the Holy Relics, and the New Knoxville Historical Museum.

Or for a little fresh air visit the Miami-Erie Canal Towpath -- a beautiful 3.5-mile hiking trail from St. Marys Memorial Park to Forty Acre Pond.
